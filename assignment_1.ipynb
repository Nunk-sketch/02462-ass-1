    "So, pooling reduces spatial size of feature maps, by down samlpling. This in turn lowers the number of parameters and computations in layers, increasing the speed and memory utilization of the NN. Pooling also increases the invariance of the model, making it less succebtible to other transformations in the input. pooling can also help with noise reduction by emphasizing important features while discarding small variations/noise. It helps generalize the model, and makes it not focus on small pixels, but the overall input. \n",

It makes the model focus on what an object is, not where it's pointed. In the same manner, different shifts in RGB can help the model recognize different objects in different lighting scenarios, as that also varies greatly in reality (Lighting, shadows, camerafilters, hues etc) so hopefully this makes the model more colour invariant.\n",

    "\n",
    "These will *not* be asked as part of the exam, and are purely for your interest\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.1. Say a network comes with a list of class probabilities:** $\\hat{p}_1, \\hat{p}_2, \\dots \\hat{p}_N$ **when is the cross-entropy in regards to the *true* class probabilities:** $p_1, p_2, \\dots p_N$ **maximized?**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **3.2. When we sample from our dataloader, we sample in batches, why is this? What would be the alternatives to sampling in batches, and what impact would that have?**\n",

    "\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.3. The \"new kid on the block' (relatively speaking) in NLP (Natural Language processing), is self-attention. Basically this is letting each word/token relate to each other word/token by a specific 'attention' value, vaguely showing how much they relate to one another... Would there be any problems in doing this for image processing by simply letting each pixel relate to each other pixel, so we can get spatial information that way instead?**\n",

    "\n",
    "**NOTE: The TAs tried this, and could not, for the life of us learn anything. Attempt this task at your peril!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💻 **3.4. A hint mentions, that if training with imagenette is taking too long, you can change the transforms of them to be smaller images, and that this *might* reduce accuracy. While making this exercise, a TA ran training with the original size of $224\\times 224$ and thereafter downsized to $60\\times 60$, both models were run for for one epoch. In the case of the downsized images, accuracy was $\\approx 0.47$ as opposed to $\\approx 0.28$ without downsizing. Try to replicate these results and explain why this might be the case.**\n",

    "\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3.5. It's often a good idea to know the what and why of our data. Search the web for documentation on the \"imagenette\" dataset. Explain what it is, who made it, where it comes from, and what classes it contains. Why do you think it can exist in a world where imagenet exists?**\n",
