    "\n",
    "So, pooling reduces spatial size of feature maps, by down samlpling. This in turn lowers the number of parameters and computations in layers, increasing the speed and memory utilization of the NN. Pooling also increases the invariance of the model, making it less succebtible to other transformations in the input. pooling can also help with noise reduction by emphasizing important features while discarding small variations/noise. It helps generalize the model, and makes it not focus on small pixels, but the overall input. \n",
    "\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.2. In the [VGG paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556), last paragraph of 'training', page 4, they mention images being randomly cropped after being rescaled. Why do you think they crop images only *after* rescaling them?**\n",

    "Well, the first thing in mind is to retain as much possible potentially important information before cropping. There is also the required input size for the network(224x224). If we did the crop first, there's a risc of distorting the image when rescaling the input. \n",

    "\n",

    "Objects don't have a designated right or left, up or down direction, so to ensure there is no bias in the direction of the data, the random horizontal flipping helps the model train on varied directional inputs, making it more robust in that regard. It makes the model focus on what an object is, not where it's pointed. In the same manner, different shifts in RGB can help the model recognize different objects in different lighting scenarios, as that also varies greatly in reality (Lighting, shadows, camerafilters, hues etc) so hopefully this makes the model more colour invariant.\n",

In the case of the downsized images, accuracy was $\\approx 0.47$ as opposed to $\\approx 0.28$ without downsizing. Try to replicate these results and explain why this might be the case.**\n",
